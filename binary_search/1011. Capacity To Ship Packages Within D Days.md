# Intuition
There is a range of weight we can try from max(arr) to sum(arr), thus applying binary search.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(NlogN)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(1)$

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        def isPossible(limit):
            curr = 0
            count = 1
            for weight in weights:
                if curr + weight <= limit:
                    curr += weight
                else:
                    count += 1
                    curr = weight
            return count <= days


        n = len(weights)
        # the minimum weight possible has to be the max of the weights
        left, right = max(weights), sum(weights)
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if isPossible(mid):
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```
