# 1. Binary Search

## Intuition
The mid will land at either ascending or descening slope, it can be reduced by half to search the reamining half for the peak point. And also because return any peak point is fine.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(logN)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(1)$

## Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums)-1
        # use < instead of <= to avoid case where mid + 1 == n
        # and case [1, 3, 2] -> need to keep index 2(val: 2) to compare 3 > 2
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            # since mid + 1 is always < n
            if nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```


# 2. Linear Search

## Intuition
Since nums[-1] considered as float('inf'), as long as the number is bigger than the next one, it means that the current one is a peak.

e.g. [1,2,3], [3,2,1], [1,2,3,2,1]

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(N)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(1)$

## Code
```python 3 []
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:
                return i
        return len(nums)-1
```
