# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    If M is the number of set function calls, N is the number of get function calls, and L is average length of key and value strings.

    Time complexity:

    In the set() function, in each call, we push a (timestamp, value) pair in the key bucket, which takes O(L) time to hash the string.
    Thus, for M calls overall it will take, O(M⋅L) time.

    In the get() function, we use binary search on the key's bucket which can have at most M elements and to hash the string it takes O(L) time, thus overall it will take O(L⋅logM) time for binary search.
    And, for N calls overall it will take, O(N⋅L⋅logM) time.

- Space complexity:
    In the set() function, in each call we store one value string of length L, which takes O(L) space.
    Thus, for M calls we may store M unique values, so overall it may take O(M⋅L) space.

    In the get() function, we are not using any additional space.
    Thus, for all N calls it is a constant space operation.

# Code
```python3 []
class TimeMap:

    def __init__(self):
        self.store = {}

    def set(self, key: str, value: str, timestamp: int) -> None:
        if key not in self.store:
            self.store[key] = []
        self.store[key].append((timestamp, value))

    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: int) -> str:
        if key not in self.store:
            return ''
        if timestamp < self.store[key][0][0]:
            return ''

        left, right = 0, len(self.store[key])-1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if self.store[key][mid][0] > timestamp:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        
        return self.store[key][left-1][1] if left-1 >= 0 else ''
