# 1. DFS

## Approach
DFS to convert "X" to "."

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(m*n)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(1)$

## Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def countBattleships(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        
        def dfs(i, j):
            board[i][j] = '.'
            for di, dj in directions:
                i_next = i + di
                j_next = j + dj
                if 0 <= i_next < m and 0 <= j_next < n and board[i_next][j_next] == 'X':
                    dfs(i_next, j_next)
        
        count = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if board[i][j] == 'X':
                    count += 1
                    dfs(i, j)
        return count
```

# 2. One Pass

## Approach
Since we loop through rows and columns, we can always check the cell above and the cell on the left to see if it is "X" or ".". If it is ".", then it must be a new ship that hasn't been discovered. If it is "X", then it must connected to a ship that has ben discovered previously. Thus, it avoid counting repeatedly.

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if board[i][j] == 'X':
                    if (
                        (i == 0 or board[i-1][j] == '.')
                        and (j == 0 or board[i][j-1] == '.')
                    ):
                        count += 1
        return count
```
