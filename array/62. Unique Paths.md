# 1. DP
## Intuition
At each grid cell, the total possible paths is sum of the cell on the left and the cell above.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(m*n)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(m*n)$

## Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        dp[0] = [1 for _ in range(n)]

        for r in range(m):
            dp[r][0] = 1

        for r in range(1, m):
            for c in range(1, n):
                dp[r][c] = dp[r-1][c] + dp[r][c-1]
        
        return dp[m-1][n-1]
```

## Improved DP
It is observed that only previous array is used, so we don't have to use m*n, instead using 1 * n is enough.

## Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        left = 1
        above = [1 for _ in range(n)]
        curr = 1
        for r in range(1, m):
            for c in range(1, n):
                curr = above[c] + left
                left = curr
                above[c] = curr
            left = 1
        return curr
```

# 2. Math

## Approach
Biomial coefficents

Now time complexity will depend on the algorithm to compute factorial
function (m+nâˆ’2)!.

The best known algorithm to compute factorial function is done by Peter Borwein.
The idea is to express the factorial as a product of prime powers,
so that k! can be computed in $O(k(logkloglogk)^2)$ time.
That's better than $O(k^2)$ and hence beats DP algorithm.

## Formula
C<sup>h</sup><sub>h+v</sub> = $(m + n - 2)! \over (m - 1)! * (n - 1)!$

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O((M+N)(log(M+N)loglog(M+N))^2)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(1)$

## Code
```python3 []
from math import factorial


class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        return factorial(m + n - 2) // factorial(n - 1) // factorial(m - 1)
```
