# 1. Prefix Sum Approach
## Approach
Build 2 arrays to get products from left to right and from right to left.
The final product at i will be product from i-1 * i+1


## Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(N)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(N)$

## Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        left_right = nums.copy()
        right_left = nums.copy()

        for i in range(1, n):
            left_right[i] *= left_right[i-1]
        
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            right_left[i] *= right_left[i+1]
        
        ans = [0 for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            left = left_right[i-1] if i-1 >= 0 else 1
            right = right_left[i+1] if i+1 < n else 1
            ans[i] = left * right
        return ans
```


# 2. Improved Prefix Sum

## Approach
We can actually save some space by using only 1 constant variable.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(N)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(1)$
    If we don't consider final output.

## Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        ans = [1 for _ in range(n)]

        # product at i, all numbers from left
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans[i] = nums[i-1] * ans[i-1]
        
        # product at i, all numbers from right, and multiply by previously left products
        prev = 1
        for i in reversed(range(n)):
            ans[i] = prev * ans[i]
            prev *= nums[i]
        
        return ans
```
