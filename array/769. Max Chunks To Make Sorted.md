# Intuition
Since the numbers are from 0 to n-1, the number has to be less than or equal to the current index. Thus we will keep a max for seen numbers until meeting an index that equals to the maximum number, at this point, count + 1.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(N)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(1)$

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def maxChunksToSorted(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        curr = arr[0]
        for i, num in enumerate(arr):
            curr = max(curr, num)
            if curr <= i:
                count += 1
                curr = num
        return count
```
