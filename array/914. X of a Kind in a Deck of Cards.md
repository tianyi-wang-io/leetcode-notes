# Approach
- If A = 0 then GCD(A,B)=B, since the GCD(0,B)=B, and we can stop.  
- If B = 0 then GCD(A,B)=A, since the GCD(A,0)=A, and we can stop.  
- Write A in quotient remainder form (A = Bâ‹…Q + R)
- Find GCD(B,R) using the Euclidean Algorithm since GCD(A,B) = GCD(B,R)

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(NlogN)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(N)$

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:
        
        def gcf(a, b):
            while b != 0:
                a, b = b, a % b
            return a
        
        counter = Counter(deck)
        return reduce(gcf, counter.values()) > 1
