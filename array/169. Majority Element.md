# 1. Boyer-Moore Voting

## Intuition
If we had some way of counting instances of the majority element as +1
and instances of any other element as âˆ’1, summing them would make it
obvious that the majority element is indeed the majority element.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(n)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(1)$

## Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        since there always a majority, the count will always >= 1.
        """
        curr = nums[0]
        count = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num == curr:
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
                if count == 0:
                    curr = num
                    count = 1
        return curr
```


# 2. Sorting

## Intuition
If the array is sorted, the majority must lie at length // 2.


## Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(logN)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(1)$ if sorted in-place, otherwise $O(N)$
    
For example:

Odd:    [<ins>1,2,3,3</ins>,4,5,6]

Even:   [<ins>1,3,3</ins>,5]

## Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        return nums[len(nums) // 2]
```
