# Intuition
Since it can be buy and sell multiple times, we will calculate each days' difference and assign the current price to the new price. Only add postive values as negative values it will be treated not buying the price from the previous day.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(N)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(1)$

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        curr_price = prices[0]
        for num in prices:
            profit += max(0, num - curr_price)
            curr_price = num
        return profit
```
