# 1. Two Pointers

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(N^2)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(1)$

## Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        nums.sort()
        closest = float('inf')
        for i in range(n-2):
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue
            left, right = i+1, n-1
            while left < right:
                curr = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
                if abs(curr - target) < abs(closest - target):
                    closest = curr

                if curr <= target:
                    left += 1
                else:
                    right -= 1
        return closest
```


# 2. Binary Search

## Approach
Loop i and j, and use binary search to find k.
if the complement is 42, and our array is [-10, -4, 15, 30, 60], the next higher is 60 (so the difference is -18), and the previous lower is 30 (and the difference is 12).

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(N^2logN)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(1)$

## Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        nums.sort()
        diff = float('inf')
        for i in range(n-2):
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue
            for j in range(i+1, n-1):
                complement = target - nums[i] - nums[j]
                high = self.bs_right(nums, complement, j+1, n)
                low = high - 1

                if low > j and abs(complement - nums[low]) < abs(diff):
                    diff = complement - nums[low]
                if high < n and abs(complement - nums[high]) < abs(diff):
                    diff = complement - nums[high]
                if diff == 0:
                        break

        return target - diff
    
    def bs_right(self, nums, target, low, high):
        while low < high:
            mid = low + (high - low) // 2
            if nums[mid] < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
