# Intuition
Keep a current minimum, and compare with current maximum profit. Update the current minimum whenever the number is lower than the current one.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(N)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(1)$

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        curr_min = prices[0]
        for num in prices:
            profit = max(profit, num - curr_min)
            curr_min = min(curr_min, num)
        return profit
```
