# Intuition
1. To have all numbers same in a same row, the possible numbers must be either in tops or bottoms or both, so we only need to check these 2 numbers.
2. Having 2 counters to see how many flips needed for both tops and bottoms on 2 tries.

Note that if there is at least one number equals to the target value in sub-function and the current tops is not equal to target value, we increase by 1. We ignore the bottom count because we know the bottoms must equal to the target value thus no need to increase by 1. We keep the minimum flips for both rows.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(N)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(N)$

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def minDominoRotations(self, tops: List[int], bottoms: List[int]) -> int:
        a = self.dominoRotations(tops, bottoms, tops[0])
        b = self.dominoRotations(tops, bottoms, bottoms[0])
        print(a, b)
        ans = min(a, b)
        return ans if ans < len(tops) else -1
    
    def dominoRotations(self, tops, bottoms, val):
        n = len(tops)
        count_top = 0
        count_bottom = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if tops[i] != val and bottoms[i] != val:
                return n+1
            elif tops[i] != val:
                count_top += 1
            elif bottoms[i] != val:
                count_bottom += 1
        return min(count_top, count_bottom)
