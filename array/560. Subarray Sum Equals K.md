# Approach
1. Using a counter hash table to store the previous seen sum, if current sum - k = previous seen sum, it means there are subarrays equal to K.
2. Initializing a 0: 1 for cases a single number equals to K.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(N)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(N)$

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        seen = Counter({0: 1})
        count = 0
        window = 0
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            window += num
            if window - k in seen:
                count += seen[window-k]
            seen[window] += 1
        return count
```
