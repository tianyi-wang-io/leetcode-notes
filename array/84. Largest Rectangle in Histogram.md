# Approach
1. store index.
2. when the height is lower than previous one, calculate the area.
    - width: current index - last index in stack. If not, fail case: [2, 4]
3. once loop over the heights, calculate remaining in the stack. Go step 2.

# Note
The reason for initialize stack with -1 is because if there is a lowest height in the middle of the array, the width N. If not using i - stack[-1], it will only get i - j.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(N)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(N)$

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = [-1]
        max_area = 0
        for i, height in enumerate(heights):
            while stack[-1] != -1 and height < heights[stack[-1]]:
                j = stack.pop()
                h = heights[j]
                w = i - stack[-1] - 1
                max_area = max(max_area, h * w)
            stack.append(i)
        
        while stack[-1] != -1:
            j = stack.pop()
            h = heights[j]
            w = len(heights) - stack[-1] - 1
            max_area = max(max_area, h * w)
        
        return max_area
```


# 2. Divide and Conquer

## Approach
This approach relies on the observation that the rectangle with maximum area will be the maximum of:

- The widest possible rectangle with height equal to the height of the shortest bar.

- The largest rectangle confined to the left of the shortest bar(subproblem).

- The largest rectangle confined to the right of the shortest bar(subproblem).

Repeating this process will get the answer.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(NlogN)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(NlogN)$

## Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        
        def helper(start, end):
            if start > end:
                return 0
            min_index = start
            for i in range(start, end+1):
                if heights[i] < heights[min_index]:
                    min_index = i
            return max(
                heights[min_index] * (end - start + 1),
                helper(start, min_index-1),
                helper(min_index+1, end)
            )
        
        return helper(0, len(heights)-1)
