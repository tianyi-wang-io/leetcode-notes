# Intuition
We return 2 numbers from each node, one from 1 step neighbor and another from 2 steps neighbor.

At each level, we either include the current node or not. If we include the current node, we will add left_2_step_away and right_2_step_away. 

If we don't include the current node, we need to get maximum of the left side and maximum of the right side. Because when this level return back to the above level, 1 step away will become 2 step away, we can return whichever has larger value. Suppose a left straight node with values [1, 2, 3, 10], when it's at node 2, we want to return 10 instead of 3 if there is a right child for node 2 and we couldn't pick node 2.


# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(N)$ traverse once in all nodes

- Space complexity:
    $O(N)$ recursion calls

# Code
```python3 []
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def rob(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return 0, 0
            left1, left2 = dfs(node.left)
            right1, right2 = dfs(node.right)
            prev1 = node.val+left2+right2
            prev2 = max(left1, left2) + max(right1, right2)
            return prev1, prev2
        
        ans1, ans2 = dfs(root)
        return max(ans1, ans2)
