# Intuition
Since it is a binary seach tree, if the current value is not in range, we only need to consider one side of subtree. We don't need to consider if both substree should be rearranged since only one side at most will be in the range.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(N)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(N)$ for recursive calls.

# Code
```python3 []
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def trimBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], low: int, high: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:

        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return node
            if node.val > high:
                node = dfs(node.left)
            elif node.val < low:
                node = dfs(node.right)
            if not node:
                return node
            node.left = dfs(node.left)
            node.right = dfs(node.right)
            return node

        return dfs(root)
