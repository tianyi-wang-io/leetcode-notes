# Intuition
At each node, we check left and right separately on increasing or decreasing order. Initialize inc and dcs with 1 at each node, and add count if condition meets.

If the current node connects left and right side, then the previous seprated computation should already have that number in inc or dcs. Remember to - 1 when combine left and right.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    $O(N)$

- Space complexity:
    $O(1)$

# Code
```python3 []
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        longest = 0

        def dfs(node):
            nonlocal longest
            if not node:
                # inc, dsc
                return 0, 0
            left_inc, left_dcs = dfs(node.left)
            right_inc, right_dcs = dfs(node.right)
            inc = 1
            dcs = 1
            if node.left:
                if node.val + 1 == node.left.val:
                    dcs += left_dcs
                elif node.val - 1 == node.left.val:
                    inc += left_inc
            if node.right:
                if node.val + 1 == node.right.val:
                    dcs = max(dcs, right_dcs + 1)
                elif node.val - 1 == node.right.val:
                    inc = max(inc, right_inc + 1)
            
            longest = max(longest, inc+dcs-1)
            return inc, dcs
