# Approach
1. Build Trie
2. Recursively find the word for ".".

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    - Add
        $O(M)$, where M is the key length. At each step, we either examine or create a node in the trie. That takes only M operations.
    - Search
        $O(M)$ for the "well-defined" words without dots, where $M$ is the key length, and N is a number of keys, and $O(Nâ‹…26 M)$ for the "undefined" words. That corresponds to the worst-case situation of searching an undefined word M times ......... which is one character longer than all inserted keys.

- Space complexity:
    - Add
        $O(M)$. In the worst-case newly inserted key doesn't share a prefix with the keys already inserted in the trie. We have to add M new nodes, which takes O(M) space.
    - Search
        $O(1)$ for the search of "well-defined" words without dots, and up to $O(M)$ for the "undefined" words, to keep the recursion stack.

# Code
```python3 []
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end = False


class WordDictionary:

    def __init__(self):
        self.trie = Trie()

    def addWord(self, word: str) -> None:
        curr = self.trie
        for char in word:
            if char not in curr.children:
                curr.children[char] = Trie()
            curr = curr.children[char]
        curr.is_end = True

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        def helper(i, curr):
            if i == len(word):
                return curr.is_end

            if word[i] in curr.children:
                return helper(i+1, curr.children[word[i]])
            elif word[i] == '.':
                for k in curr.children:
                    # if is necessary to check all possibilities,
                    # otherwise it will only try the first possibility
                    # if return the function directly
                    if helper(i+1, curr.children[k]):
                        return True
            return False

        return helper(0, self.trie)



# Your WordDictionary object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = WordDictionary()
# obj.addWord(word)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)
